# IR_Final_Project

This project is a comprehensive web scraping and content extraction pipeline designed to collect and process opportunity listings from [opportunitiescircle.com](https://www.opportunitiescircle.com/). It features a recommendation system based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and user ratings, which is accessible through both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI).

The pipeline automates the process of fetching, extracting, and analyzing data, making it easier to discover and recommend opportunities tailored to user preferences. The GUI allows users to interact with the system by creating profiles, receiving recommendations, and providing feedback through ratings. These ratings are then used to improve the recommendation model.

```

## Usage
1. Build a Python environment.
2. Run the following command to install the required packages, fetch data and train models:
```bash
./init.sh
```
3. Run the Flask application using the following command and open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5001` (or `http://localhost:5001`).:
```bash
./launch_app.sh
```

The GUI allows new users to:
* Register with their name.
* Create a profile by specifying their age group and department.
* Receive and rate a selection of 5 activities recommended by our model.

User profiles and their ratings are stored in `method2/user_ratings.jsonl`.

4. You can use the following command to evaluate the model:
```bash
./evaluation.sh
```
